# Ark
A full-stack monolithic application that heavily emphasizes its (IAM) solution. Initially, it was supposed to be closed source because it was going to be used for a side project, but I decided to release it to the public for personal reasons.

Technically, it is not a full stack just yet, I haven't wrote the frontend yet.
